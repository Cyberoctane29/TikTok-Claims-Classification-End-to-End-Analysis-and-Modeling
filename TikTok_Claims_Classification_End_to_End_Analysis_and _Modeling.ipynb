    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "TikTok, one of the world's leading platforms for short-form mobile videos, has brought me on board as the newest member of its data analytics team. My team is working on developing a machine learning model to classify claims made in videos submitted to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "At TikTok, the mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. TikTok employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with the company's flat structure, I have dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow my career.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Company Background**  \n",
    "\n",
    "TikTok, the short-form video hosting company is the global-hub and leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content where people can safely discover, create, and connect. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **The TikTok Scenario**  \n",
    "\n",
    "As part of TikTok’s data team, my role involves tackling an important challenge: handling user-reported claims in videos. TikTok users can flag videos and comments they believe contain unverified claims, generating a high volume of reports. These reports must be reviewed by moderators, but the sheer volume makes it difficult to process them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, TikTok is developing a **predictive model** that can automatically determine whether a video contains a **claim** or an **opinion**. I will work mainly on this task, ensuring the model is effective in **reducing the backlog of user reports** and **prioritizing moderation efforts more efficiently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Scope**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify claims in TikTok videos. It involves data exploration, statistical analysis, and visualization using Python and Tableau, followed by the development of a multiple logistic regression model. The project then includes the main model champion selection based on the development and evaluation of Random Forest and XGBoost, along with an n-gram tokenizer commonly used to process textual information for prediction and classification tasks. A detailed breakdown of these steps will be provided in the overview section.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, the project aims to create a reliable machine learning pipeline to enhance content moderation efficiency on TikTok.  "

    "## **Overview**\n",
    "- This project strictly follows the **PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework** at its core. More details about this framework are explained in **Phase 1 - Milestone 1**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Emails**: At the start of each phase, an **email from the phase's relevant stakeholder** is linked (stakeholders specific to each phase are mentioned in the phase overview). These emails, sent by stakeholders, team members, or cross-functional team members, provide essential details about the task and the project phase. They should be reviewed carefully, and the provided instructions should be followed to complete the **phase project**, including the **phase-specific code notebook, executive summary, PACE strategy document, and any other phase-specific document**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Executive Summary**: At the end of applicable phases, an **executive summary** is linked. This summary is designed to effectively communicate the insights gained during the phase. It keeps **TikTok teammates informed** about project progress in a **concise one-page format**, respecting the time constraints of stakeholders who may not be able to read the full report.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Pace Strategy Document**: Similarly, at the end of each phase, the **PACE strategy document** is linked. This document outlines my approach to the tasks and answers key questions about the project phase. The **Data Project Questions & Considerations** section of the document includes questions that help deepen my understanding of data analytics. Completing this document is essential before preparing the **executive summary**, ensuring that the phase-related insights are communicated concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each phase follows this structured workflow, where I:  \n",
    "  - **Review the email** from the stakeholder to understand the project phase details and gather information about the business problem or question to be addressed.  \n",
    "  - **Execute the tasks** outlined for the phase in the respective project section.  \n",
    "  - **Complete the PACE strategy document** to define the approach and respond to key guiding questions.  \n",
    "  - **Prepare the executive summary** to effectively communicate findings and share insights with stakeholders and team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures **effective communication and strong project management** throughout the claims classification project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stakeholders & Team Members**\n",
    "\n",
    "**TikTok Data Team:**\n",
    "- **Willow Jaffey** – Data Science Lead\n",
    "- **Rosie Mae Bradshaw** – Data Science Manager\n",
    "- **Orion Rainier** – Data Scientist  \n",
    "  *These technical team members require concise and specific communication.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Functional Team Members:**\n",
    "- **Mary Joanna Rodgers** – Project Management Officer\n",
    "- **Margery Adebowale** – Finance Lead, Americas\n",
    "- **Maika Abadi** – Operations Lead  \n",
    "  *These managers oversee operations and require communication that is adapted to their less technical roles.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Effective Communication in Each Phase**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each phase not only focuses on technical execution but also helps me develop critical **communication skills** essential for success in a data-driven role. Throughout the project, I will:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ask questions** to clarify project goals, requirements, and stakeholder expectations.  \n",
    "- **Share project needs** to ensure alignment and resource availability.  \n",
    "- **Communicate with stakeholders** by presenting findings clearly and concisely.  \n",
    "- **Give and receive feedback** to refine analyses and improve project outcomes.  \n",
    "- **Stay in contact with team members** to foster collaboration and maintain project momentum.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these communication strategies in each phase, I ensure that both technical and non-technical stakeholders remain informed and engaged throughout the **claims classification project phases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Phases Overview**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** Creating a project proposal by defining the required data analytical tasks and assigning them into realistic milestones to guide future steps in the claims classification project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 2:** The team has been granted access to TikTok’s user data. To gain clear insights, the data must be inspected, organized, and prepared for analysis. I will assist by building a dataframe and structuring the claims data for exploratory data analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 3:** Initiating the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process. I will conduct EDA for the claims classification project and use Tableau to create visualizations for an executive summary, enabling non-technical stakeholders to engage with and interpret the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 4:** With exploratory data analysis completed, the team will begin hypothesis testing. I will analyze TikTok's user claim dataset to determine the most appropriate hypothesis testing method for the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 5:** Using the project data, I will develop a logistic regression model as a baseline for classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase 6:** The final milestone involves building the machine learning model and selecting the champion model based on evaluation. Random Forest and XGBoost will be considered for model selection, and an n-gram tokenizer will be used to process textual data for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each phase follows the **PACE framework** and includes corresponding **emails, executive summaries, and PACE strategy documents** to ensure a structured, well-documented approach."

    "### Understanding the PACE Framework  \n",
    "![PACE.png](attachment:PACE.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **PACE** framework (**Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute**) provides a structured yet flexible approach to managing data analysis projects. It ensures clear organization, facilitates communication, and supports an iterative workflow by allowing revisiting of previous stages without disruption. Communication is essential throughout PACE, much like electricity flowing through a circuit, enabling continuous collaboration—whether through asking questions, gathering data, updating stakeholders, or presenting findings and receiving feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Workflow Structures  \n",
    "Large-scale data projects require structured workflows to manage tasks efficiently. Identifying potential blockers early in the process allows for better resource planning and minimizes disruptions. A well-defined workflow promotes **efficiency, collaboration, and streamlined decision-making**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying PACE to This Project  \n",
    "Each **phase** in this project is categorized into one or more **PACE stages**, based on how its **milestones** are classified in the **project proposal**. At the start of each phase, the corresponding PACE stage(s) will be indicated. Within each phase, the project is further structured into milestones for a broader perspective, while also being divided into the applicable PACE stage(s), ensuring a clear and organized workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, **Milestone 1 of Phase 1** falls under the **Plan** stage. To visually indicate the primary **PACE stage** of each phase, an **image representing the stage** is placed at the beginning of the phase—for instance, the **Plan** image is attached **at the start of Phase 1** since it belongs to the **Plan** stage. If a phase spans **multiple PACE stages**, multiple images will be used accordingly at the beginning of the phase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Phase 1**, both milestones were categorized as **Plan** in the project proposal, making this phase fully part of the **Plan** stage. However, other phases may span multiple PACE stages depending on how their milestones are classified in the project proposal. For instance, in **Phase 1 - Milestone 1a**, the project proposal clearly identifies the corresponding PACE stage for each milestone, ensuring a structured approach throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of PACE Stages  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a closer look at each stage of the PACE model, along with the images that represent each stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Plan**  \n",
    "![Plan.png](attachment:Plan.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage establishes a solid foundation by defining the project scope, gathering requirements, and setting objectives. Key activities include:  \n",
    "- Researching business data  \n",
    "- Defining project scope  \n",
    "- Developing a workflow  \n",
    "- Assessing stakeholder needs  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Analyze**  \n",
    "![Analyze-2.png](attachment:Analyze-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, data is acquired, cleaned, and explored through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. Key activities include:  \n",
    "- Data collection and formatting  \n",
    "- Handling missing values and inconsistencies  \n",
    "- Performing initial statistical analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Construct**\n",
    "![Construct-2.png](attachment:Construct-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage focuses on building and refining models, often incorporating machine learning techniques. Key activities include:  \n",
    "- Selecting modeling approaches  \n",
    "- Building and training models  \n",
    "- Evaluating model performance  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Execute**  \n",
    "![Execute-2.png](attachment:Execute-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings are communicated to stakeholders, incorporating feedback and refining outputs. Key activities include:  \n",
    "- Presenting results  \n",
    "- Addressing stakeholder feedback  \n",
    "- Finalizing reports  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication in PACE  \n",
    "Effective **communication** is essential across all PACE stages. Whether clarifying project goals, presenting findings, or incorporating feedback, ongoing dialogue ensures alignment and enhances decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptability of PACE  \n",
    "While PACE is presented sequentially, real-world projects require flexibility. It’s common to revisit earlier stages as new insights emerge. This adaptability prepares professionals for dynamic, evolving data projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the **PACE framework**, I will structure this project efficiently, ensuring each phase progresses smoothly while maintaining the flexibility to adapt as needed."

    "\n",
    "- **Video View Count (`video_view_count`)**: The high mean (254,708) and large standard deviation (322,893) show significant variability in view counts.

    "\n",
    "- **Shares:**\n",
    "  - Again, banned users have a higher mean (29,998.94) and median (14,468.0) of shares compared to active users (mean: 14,111.47, median: 437.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight:**\n",
    "- Despite the lower total count of views, likes, and shares, banned users tend to generate higher engagement per post (mean and median) than active users. This could suggest that controversial content (such as claims) posted by banned users tends to garner more attention, possibly due to its nature or sensationalism.\n"

    "#### **Engagement Comparison: Claim vs. Opinion Videos**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comparison between claim and opinion videos reveals several patterns in terms of views, comments, likes, and shares across different groups (active, banned, and under review). Here are the key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Count (Common in Views, Comments, Likes, and Shares):**\n",
    "- The occurrence of claims is greater than that of opinions in total. However, the claim-active group has fewer occurrences compared to the opinion-active group. \n",
    "- For the opinion-banned and opinion-under review groups, there are fewer occurrences than in the claim-banned and claim-under review groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Views:**  \n",
    "- **Mean:** The view mean for the claim-active, claim-banned, and claim-under review groups is much greater than that of the corresponding opinion groups.  \n",
    "- **Median:** Similar to the mean, the median view count for the claim groups is higher than that for the opinion groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Comments:**  \n",
    "- **Mean:** The mean number of comments for each claim group (claim-active, claim-banned, claim-under review) is much greater than for the corresponding opinion groups.  \n",
    "- **Median:** The comment median follows the same pattern as the mean, with the claim groups having higher values than the opinion groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Comments per View:**  \n",
    "- **Mean:** The mean of comments per view for all three claim groups is higher than for all three opinion groups.  \n",
    "- **Median:** The median for comments per view follows the same trend, with the claim groups outperforming the opinion groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Likes:**  \n",
    "- **Mean:** The like mean for each claim group (claim-active, claim-banned, claim-under review) is much greater than for the corresponding opinion groups.  \n",
    "- **Median:** The like median mirrors the mean, with claim groups having higher values than opinion groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Likes per View:**  \n",
    "- **Mean:** The mean of likes per view for all three claim groups is higher than for the opinion groups.  \n",
    "- **Median:** The median of likes per view follows the same trend, with the claim groups having higher values than the opinion groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Shares:**  \n",
    "- **Mean:** The mean share count for each claim group (claim-active, claim-banned, claim-under review) is much greater than for the corresponding opinion groups.  \n",
    "- **Median:** The share median shows the same pattern as the mean, with claim groups having higher values than opinion groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Shares per View:**  \n",
    "- **Mean:** The mean of shares per view for all three claim groups is higher than for all three opinion groups.  \n",
    "- **Median:** The median of shares per view follows the same trend, with the claim groups having higher values than the opinion groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Insight:**\n",
    "- The claim category generally shows higher values for views, comments, likes, and shares, both in terms of the mean and median, compared to the opinion category. This trend is observed across different groups (active, banned, and under review). \n",
    "- The higher engagement in the claim category could indicate that claim videos tend to generate more interaction, possibly due to their controversial or attention-grabbing nature."

    "\n",
    "- Views, likes, shares, downloads, and comments correlate with a video's `claim_status`. These factors are indicative of the level of engagement a video receives, which may influence its categorization as a claim.  \n",

Additionally, claim videos tend to have higher engagement rates (e.g., likes per view or shares per view), further demonstrating their correlation with these factors.  \n",

    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Phase 2**, I focused on understanding and preparing the data needed for the claims classification project. This phase involved building a **dataframe** in Python and performing initial steps of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. By using Boolean masking, I was able to analyze engagement trends across different claim statuses and calculate key metrics such as **mean**, **median**, and **engagement rates** for videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "The skills gained in this phase provided a solid foundation for further exploration and analysis in the coming stages of the project. I also gained experience in using Python for **data manipulation**, **data visualization**, and effectively communicating insights to stakeholders through an **executive summary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase has enhanced my ability to prepare data for more in-depth analysis and demonstrated the importance of organizing and communicating data insights effectively to stakeholders. \n",
