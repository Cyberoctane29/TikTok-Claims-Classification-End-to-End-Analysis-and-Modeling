    "\n",
    "When reviewing the output of `data.info()`, I noticed the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Textual Information**: The columns containing textual data, such as `video_transcription_text`, are classified as `object` type in Pandas. This is because strings in Pandas are represented as `object` type.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Numeric Data**: Some fields are of `float64` type, while others are `int64`. Upon closer inspection, I found that the `float64` fields could be converted to `int64` without any loss of information, as these values are discrete (e.g., view counts, like counts, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Values**: There are **298 null values** in 7 of the 12 columns, which are:\n",
    "  - `claim_status`\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Null Values Pattern**: What stands out is that for the fields with null values (listed above), if one field contains null, the others typically have null values as well. This suggests that missing data might be related or interconnected across these fields.\n",

    "  - `video_view_count`\n",
    "  - `video_like_count`\n",

    "  - `video_download_count`\n",
    "  - `video_comment_count`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "- **Video Duration (`video_duration_sec`)**:\n",
    "  - The **mean** is 32.42 seconds, and the **median** is 32 seconds, suggesting that the data is relatively centered around this value.\n",
    "  - The **standard deviation (std)** is 16.23, which is relatively low compared to other columns, indicating **low variability** in `video_duration_sec`. Most videos have durations close to 32 seconds, suggesting consistency in video lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video View Count (`video_view_count`)**:\n",
    "  - The **mean** is 254,708, and the **std** is 322,893, which is quite high, indicating **high variability** in the number of views across videos.\n",
    "  - The gap between the **75th percentile (504,327)** and the **maximum value (999,817)** suggests the presence of **outliers**, where a few videos receive disproportionately higher views compared to the majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video Like Count (`video_like_count`)**:\n",
    "  - The **std** of 133,420 is large relative to the mean, reflecting **high variability** in the like counts.\n",
    "  - The distribution is **right-skewed**, with some videos having significantly higher likes than the majority. The gap between the **75th percentile (125,020)** and the **maximum (657,830)** confirms the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video Share Count (`video_share_count`)**:\n",
    "  - The **std** is 32,036, which is large relative to the mean of 16,735, indicating **high variability** in shares.\n",
    "  - The distribution appears to be **right-skewed**, with a few videos having significantly higher share counts compared to the majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video Download Count (`video_download_count`)**:\n",
    "  - The **std** is 2,004, which is significantly larger than the mean (1,049), highlighting **variability** in download counts.\n",
    "  - There are a few videos with exceptionally high download counts, as evidenced by the gap between the **75th percentile (1,156.25)** and the **maximum value (14,994)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video Comment Count (`video_comment_count`)**:\n",
    "  - The **std** is 799.63, which is high compared to the mean (349.31), indicating **variability** in comment counts.\n",
    "  - The distribution is also **right-skewed**, with a few videos receiving disproportionately higher comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outliers and Standard Deviation:\n",
    "- For most columns, the **standard deviation is large**, particularly for `video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, and `video_share_count`. This indicates that the values are widely spread and influenced by **outliers**.\n",
    "- The **high difference between the 75th percentile and the maximum values** in several columns supports the observation of **outliers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- There is noticeable **high variability** and **right-skewness** in key variables such as `video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, and `video_share_count`.\n",
    "- **Outliers** are a significant factor in these distributions, as reflected by both the **high standard deviation** and the difference between quartiles and the maximum values. These should be carefully examined, as they can impact further analysis and model performance."

    "\n",
    "- I noticed that the number of banned users is higher in the `claim` category than in the `opinion` category for the corresponding `author_ban_status`.  \n",
    "- This relationship may occur because claims are often made by unsourced or untrusted individuals. As a result, a significant portion of these claims may come from accounts that have been banned, possibly due to spreading misinformation or violating platform policies.  \n",
    "- Additionally, it is possible that claim videos are more strictly policed than opinion videos, or that authors posting claims are required to comply with stricter rules compared to those posting opinions.  \n",

    "- The higher number of banned users in the `claim` category may indicate a trend where accounts making claims are more likely to be flagged and banned for policy violations.  \n",

Banned authors may have also posted content that fully complied with the platform's terms of service.  \n",

    "I noticed the following differences between banned and active authors in terms of views, likes, and shares:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Views:**\n",
    "  - Banned users have a higher mean (445,845.44) and median (448,201.0) of views compared to active users (mean: 215,927.04, median: 8,616.0). However, banned users have a lower count of views overall.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Likes:**\n",
    "  - Banned users have a higher mean (153,017.24) and median (105,573.0) of likes compared to active users (mean: 71,036.53, median: 2,222.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shares:**\n",
    "  - Again, banned users have a higher mean (29,998.94) and median (14,468.0) of shares compared to active users (mean: 14,111.47, median: 437.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "- Despite the lower total count of views, likes, and shares, banned users tend to generate higher engagement per post (mean and median) than active users. This could suggest that controversial content (such as claims) posted by banned users tends to garner more attention, possibly due to its nature or sensationalism.\n",

    "How does the data for claim videos and opinion videos compare or differ? Consider views, comments, likes, and shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comparison between claim and opinion videos reveals several patterns in terms of views, comments, likes, and shares across different groups (active, banned, and under review). Here are the key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Count (Common in Views, Comments, Likes, and Shares):**\n",
    "- The occurrence of claims is greater than that of opinions in total. However, the claim-active group has fewer occurrences compared to the opinion-active group. \n",
    "- For the opinion-banned and opinion-under review groups, there are fewer occurrences than in the claim-banned and claim-under review groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Views:**\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "  - The view mean for the claim-active, claim-banned, and claim-under review groups is much greater than that of the corresponding opinion groups.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "  - Similar to the mean, the median view count for the claim groups is higher than that for the opinion groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Comments:**\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "  - The mean number of comments for each claim group (claim-active, claim-banned, claim-under review) is much greater than for the corresponding opinion groups.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "  - The comment median follows the same pattern as the mean, with the claim groups having higher values than the opinion groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Comments per View:**\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "  - The mean of comments per view for all three claim groups is higher than for all three opinion groups.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "  - The median for comments per view follows the same trend, with the claim groups outperforming the opinion groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Likes:**\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "  - The like mean for each claim group (claim-active, claim-banned, claim-under review) is much greater than for the corresponding opinion groups.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "  - The like median mirrors the mean, with claim groups having higher values than opinion groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Likes per View:**\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "  - The mean of likes per view for all three claim groups is higher than for the opinion groups.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "  - The median of likes per view follows the same trend, with the claim groups having higher values than the opinion groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Shares:**\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "  - The mean share count for each claim group (claim-active, claim-banned, claim-under review) is much greater than for the corresponding opinion groups.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "  - The share median shows the same pattern as the mean, with claim groups having higher values than opinion groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Shares per View:**\n",
    "- **Mean:**\n",
    "  - The mean of shares per view for all three claim groups is higher than for all three opinion groups.\n",
    "- **Median:**\n",
    "  - The median of shares per view follows the same trend, with the claim groups having higher values than the opinion groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "- The claim category generally shows higher values for views, comments, likes, and shares, both in terms of the mean and median, compared to the opinion category. This trend is observed across different groups (active, banned, and under review). \n",
    "- The higher engagement in the claim category could indicate that claim videos tend to generate more interaction, possibly due to their controversial or attention-grabbing nature.\n"
